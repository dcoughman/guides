To calculate the area of a rectangle you will need to multiply the length by the width.

For example, if the rectangle in question measures 5 by 3 then the area is 15.  
Also, the unit measure will be a square measurement.  So in our 5 x 3 example, if it measures 5 feet by 3 feet then the area is 15 square feet.
